# Module 6 - Problem Set No. 9 Problem 1

## Random Student Generator

Build a Python program that uses **a list of 19 students**, shuffles the list 20,000 times and then displays the list of shuffled students.

**Hints:** Use the Python.org site to research built-in random and list functions you can use to help solve this problem. Also, the shuffle() function shuffles in-place. No new variable is required.

You must code your solution using both a main() function and one named shuffleStudents(). When you output each of the individual students, number them starting at 1.

Here's a list of random student names to get you started:

```Python
students = ["Jason","Josh","Kalina","Patrick","Sam","Rachel","Quinn H.","Brandon","Robin","Jeremy","Wayne","Connor","Chris","Fred","Jacob","McGuire","Quinn C.","Drake","Eugene"]
```
