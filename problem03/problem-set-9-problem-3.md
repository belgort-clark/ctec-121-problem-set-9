# Module 6 - Problem Set No. 8 Problem 3

## Cube that List Please

Write a Python program that builds a LIST of numbers and then has that list of numbers cubed, using functions. Your first function should build a list by asking a user for the number of "numbers" they want to add to the list. You will then loop that number of times appending numbers to the list. Once all the numbers have been entered, you will call another function to have the LIST of numbers cubed. Have a main() function to handle the main-line logic.
